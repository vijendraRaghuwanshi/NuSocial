# Social

The purpose of this app is to solve the common problem which a student (living in hostel) in College/University faces. The features that are included in the app are:
- __sharing__: have something to share or need something (such as notes, books, games, or anything), this is the place for it.
- __broadcast__: transmits local message to specific group/batch/year or to all students. 
- __brag__: share reviews (about website or courses) or your achivements.
- __newsfeed__: all the local news over here.

## How it works
* To use this app, the use must login with his/her University account. (We'll be using firebase for that).
* There is `navigation drawer` so as to navigate between different features. 
* From the `dashboard` the user can add his post (such as sharing or add brag).
* Few specific users will be granted access to `broadcast` message either to batch or everyone. These specific users will be decided by the maintainer of the app. Howerver, a user can ask for permission by giving valid reasons.
